# üè® Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

> **"Unlock Booking Behaviors ‚Äî Plan Smarter, Travel Better"**

This end-to-end data analytics project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover insights, predict booking cancellations, and visualize customer behavior using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## üìå Problem Statement

Hotels often face large financial losses and operational inefficiencies due to frequent booking cancellations.  
This project aims to:
- **Predict which bookings are likely to be canceled**
- **Understand booking patterns and customer segments**
- **Provide decision-makers with a dynamic dashboard for smarter planning**

## üß† Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw hotel booking data (119K+ rows, 32 features)
- Engineer new features (like `total_guests`, `total_nights`, etc.)
- Train a predictive model to classify bookings as "Canceled" or "Not Canceled"
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore cancellation trends by:
  - Month
  - Country
  - Market segment
  - Room type

## üìà Machine Learning Approach

- **Target Variable:** `is_canceled` (1 = Canceled, 0 = Not Canceled)
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Important Features:** Lead time, Deposit type, Customer type, Previous cancellations

---

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard offers:
- Total Cancellation Count, Repeated Guests, and Stay Distribution
- Monthly Cancellation Trends
- Market Segment-wise cancellation
- Country-wise guest distribution
- Room type demand stability

## üîç Key Insights

- **August & July** saw the highest cancellation volumes
- **Online TA** segment had over 50% of cancellations
- **Portugal (PRT)** contributed the highest number of repeated guests
- Guests are more likely to book for **weeknights** than weekends
- **Non-refundable deposits** and long lead times increase cancellation risk
